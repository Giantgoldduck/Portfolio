            <p>MY SHORT STORY</p>
            <p>
                <p>Hello, everyone ! My name is  Calvin and I'm excited to share a bit about myself with you today. I may be a fitness addict, but I've also embraced the world of coding just a year ago. My journey has been an blend of fitness and software development, and I'm here to tell you all about it.</p>
                
                
                <p>Around a year ago, I embarked on a new adventure - coding. What started as a curiosity quickly transformed into a passion. I began learning the fundamentals of programming languages and was fascinated by the endless possibilities that coding offered. I realized that much like in sports, coding required dedication, practice, and a keen eye for detail.</p>
                
                <p>One of the most exciting aspects of my coding journey has been delving into web development. I've been working on creating dynamic websites that not only look great but also provide a seamless user experience. From HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond, I've been immersing myself in the world of web technologies. I find it thrilling to bring ideas to life on the web, creating interactive and visually appealing platforms.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to web development, I'm also in the early stages of developing my very first video game. It's a 2D game that combines my love for coding and my passion for gaming. While it's still a work in progress, I'm excited about the creative process and the challenges it presents. This project allows me to blend my skills and interests, pushing the boundaries of what I can create.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a bit better. I'm looking forward to sharing more about my coding projects and sports achievements in the future!
